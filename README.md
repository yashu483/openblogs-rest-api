# openblogs-rest-api
A monorepo-based blogging platform consisting of a RESTful API and two separate frontend applications (for readers and writers). Authenticated users can create and manage their own blogs. The backend follows REST principles, uses JWT for API authentication, and implements secure username/password-based login.
